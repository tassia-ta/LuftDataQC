    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents the results of the **LuftDataQC** project, which analyzed hourly PM2.5 concentrations measured by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) in Oslo during 2023. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow from raw data acquisition to anomaly detection and showcases practical skills in **API integration, SQL-based storage, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and machine learning (ML)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two NILU stations were selected for detailed study due to their contrasting environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Skøyen** — urban traffic influence.\n",
    "* **Furulund** — residential background.\n",
    "\n",
    "PM2.5 is a key pollutant associated with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality, making it an important target for transparent analysis and decision support.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data Collection and Storage (Notebook 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hourly PM2.5 measurements for all NILU Oslo stations in 2023 were collected via the NILU Open API and stored in a **SQLite** database for reproducibility and efficient querying.\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (Notebook 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality and Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality control included checks for missing values, duplicates, and plausible value ranges. Distributional differences between stations were assessed to inform statistical choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PM2.5 Distribution – Boxplot + Histogram (Skøyen vs. Furulund)](../results/pm25_distribution_box_hist_skøyen_furulund.png)\n",
    "*Figure: PM2.5 Distribution – Boxplot + Histogram (Skøyen vs. Furulund)* \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale for non-parametric testing:** PM2.5 distributions were skewed and non-normal; therefore, the **Mann–Whitney U** test was preferred over a t-test due to its robustness to outliers and lack of normality assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hourly Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Diurnal behavior reflects traffic and activity cycles.\n",

    "*Figure: PM2.5 Monthly Trends (Skøyen vs. Furulund)* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weekday vs Weekend\n",
    "\n",

    "## Feature Engineering & Anomaly Detection (Notebook 3)\n",
    " \n",
    "This proof-of-concept illustrates how machine learning can support **real-time air-quality monitoring** by flagging unusual hourly PM2.5 values for expert inspection. These features provide concise temporal context. Anomalies may reflect either genuine pollution episodes or  **sensor irregularities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 - Contamination Validation  \n",
    "IsolationForest was evaluated with contamination values of **0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5%** to calibrate model sensitivity.  \n",
    "Visual assessment indicated that a contamination rate of **1%** provided the most appropriate balance between sensitivity to rare pollution spikes and control of false positives.\n",

    "*Figure: Contamination Comparison – Furulund*  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 - Temporal Feature Engineering  \n",
    "Time-based features were derived from the timestamp, including hour, weekday, and weekend flags (with human-readable names for visualization).  \n",
    "These features provide minimal yet meaningful temporal context, helping to distinguish **expected variations** (e.g., rush hours, seasonal patterns) from **atypical events**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results (1% contamination)  \n",
    "With the selected parameter, IsolationForest identified candidate anomalies at both stations. Visual inspection shows that some anomalies correspond to plausible pollution spikes, while others may be linked to sensor artifacts.  \n",
    "**Domain expertise remains essential** to interpret flagged events in context.\n",

    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Urban–residential contrast:** Skøyen records higher and more variable PM2.5 than Furulund.  \n",
    "* **Temporal structure:** Clear diurnal and seasonal cycles align with traffic intensity and winter conditions.  \n",
    "* **ML-assisted QA/QC (Quality Assurance / Quality Control):** IsolationForest effectively highlights candidate anomalies for expert review.  \n",
    "* **Statistical evidence:** Non-parametric tests confirm significant differences between the two stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope and Future Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Baseline:** Analysis focused on NILU validated 2023 data. Year 2024 was excluded to ensure reliability, as QA/QC\n",
    "validation was not complete at the time of analysis.  \n",
    "* **Coverage:** The study is limited to two Oslo stations as a case study; the pipeline is designed to scale to multiple stations and longer timeframes.  \n",
    "* **Potential extensions:**  \n",
    "  - Incorporate meteorological variables (temperature, wind, humidity) to refine anomaly interpretation.  \n",
    "  - Extend to multi-year, multi-station analysis for broader applicability.  \n",
    "  - Benchmark alternative anomaly detection methods (e.g., One-Class SVM, autoencoders).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This pilot analysis demonstrates the feasibility of applying anomaly detection techniques to environmental monitoring.  \n",
    "The established pipeline - **data ingestion - EDA - feature engineering - anomaly detection - visualization** - is reproducible and scalable.  \n",
    "Candidate anomalies represent **candidates for expert review** rather than final labels, underscoring the need for contextual interpretation before operational use.\n"
